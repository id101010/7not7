### Summary

7x7 is a concentration game which challenges you to connect 4 or more blocks of the same color on the game field.
To make things harder each round n blocks of random colors get thrown upon the field and the number n increases with each level.
You can choose the field size to be either 7x7, 8x8, 9x9 or 10x10.

### How to play

The goal is to clear as much lines as possible by stacking blocks of the same color in any direction.
So you can eighter build up blocks vertically, horizontally or diagonal.
To move blocks click on the block you want to move, hold the mouse and release it on the target position.

### Tools and how to get them

To make things more fun and to survive in higher levels there are the following two tools. 

- Undo

An undo simply undos the last action on the game field. At the beginning you start with only two undos. You'll get an undo on each level-up.

- FreeMove

Additionally you earn FreeMoves by completing combos. FreeMoves enable you to bend the space time continuum and replace a block anywhere on the game field even if its surrounded by other blocks. 

### Combos

A combo is a game move in which you clear more than just one distinct line in one move.
