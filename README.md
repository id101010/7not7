## How to play

The goal is to clear as much lines as possible by stacking blocks of the same color in any direction.
So you can eighter build up blocks vertically, horizontally or diagonal.

## Tools and how to get them

To make things more fun and to survive in higher levels there are 2 tools. 

- FreeMove

An undo simply undos the last action on the game field. At the beginning you start with only two undos. You'll get an undo on each level-up.

- Undo

Additionally you earn FreeMoves by completing combos. FreeMoves enable you to bend the space time continuum and replace a block anywhere on the game field even if its surrounded by other blocks. 

## Combos

A combo is a game move in which you clear more than just one distinct line in one move.
